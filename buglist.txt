1.  When I enqueued twice, and dequeued once, then peeked the top of the queue, it returned the incorrect top of the queue.
2. Enqueued twice, peeked the top and it returned the incorrect value.
     1 & 2 a.   This can mean there is something wrong with the enqueuing. It may be acting like a stack when it adds a new value to the front instead of the back.
     1 & 2 b.   However, This can also mean the peekfront may be peeking the back, not the front
3. Dequeue removing from the front of queue instead of the back (this may be also because peekfront is peeking the back maybe)
4. In the Queue.h file, in the comments it says the Dequeue returns "The value of the entry at the front of the queue." However, the Dequeue funciton is a "void," voids cannot return an int that is the value of the entry.
5. Ran valgrind, and it said: "definitely lost: 48 bytes in 3 blocks (included screenshot)"
